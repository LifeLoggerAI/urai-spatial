// sample privacy, exact manifest identity, title containment, expanded mobile
// navigator bounds, history restoration, reduced-motion parity, 320px/landscape
// reflow, native button/filter semantics, focus return, disclosed RTL/text stress,
// supporting route scroll ownership, and reachable first-run instructions.
// Re-reviewed on Spatial #1567 after the bounded two-viewport onboarding proof
// envelope changed from 120s to 300s; no product assertion was removed or weakened.
// The tamper test still rejects weaker manifest assertions or unknown proof bytes.
